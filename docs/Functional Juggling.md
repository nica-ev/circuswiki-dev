# Functional Juggling

## Allgemeine Konzepte
[[Functional Juggling - Definition]]

[[5-Step Methode]]
[[Time on Task]]
[[Flow]]

## Research

- study from Lapo about sequence planning capacity increase through passive participation in juggleboard sessions. Note: this might be related to [[Luzides Tr채umen]] - lucid dreams are used in sports to train while sleeping (check the research on that), just neurons firing without an actual movement involved - during juggleboard sessions it was passive reacting that also triggered the increase in capacity.
- one makes use of movement-planning just in the brain without doing the movements
- the other does the movements but skips the movement-planning
- so its just about neurons that fire ? no matter why?
