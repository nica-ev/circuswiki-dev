# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Scope

CircusWiki is a Markdown-based knowledge commons for circus pedagogy, movement pedagogy, inclusive practice, games, organizational documentation, and related material.

The repository scope includes both:

- the content itself, primarily under `docs/`
- the surrounding working infrastructure, including the Obsidian vault setup, local tools, translation tooling, static site generation, staging scripts, generated-site assets, and project documentation

Do not treat this as only a website repository. The raw Markdown/YAML content and the local authoring workflow are core project assets.

## Current Architecture

This repo is a clean rebuild of the older setup.

- Content is authored as an Obsidian-compatible vault.
- Public site generation uses Zensical.
- The previous MkDocs Material, MkDocs Publisher, Cursor, and Task Master based workflow is historical only.
- Do not reintroduce old MkDocs/Cursor/Task Master tooling unless explicitly asked.
- Generated staging and build output belong in `.build/` and `site/`; both are ignored by Git.
- Language and site metadata are centralized in `tools/config/languages.json` and accessed through `tools/core/languages.py`.

Relevant paths:

- `docs/<lang>/`: language-specific Markdown content
- `docs/img/`: shared media assets
- `site-assets/`: assets copied into generated language builds
- `tools/`: local build, staging, translation, navigation, Obsidian bridge, and dev-console scripts
- `.obsidian/`: Obsidian vault configuration and part of the project
- `_templates/`: Obsidian templates
- `_dataview/`: Dataview helper notes and queries
- `_canvas/`: Obsidian canvas files
- `_inbox/`: drafts, raw material, and working notes
- `_system/`: current vault maintenance and architecture notes
- `zensical*.toml`: Zensical site configurations per language

German (`de`) is the default public language root. Other configured languages are published below their language code, for example:

```text
/circuswiki/example/
/circuswiki/en/example/
/circuswiki/pl/example/
```

Language folders should preserve matching relative paths where possible:

```text
docs/de/spiele/example.md
docs/en/spiele/example.md
```

Use the registry for the current configured language set instead of duplicating language lists in documentation or scripts.

## Project Philosophy

The technical manual in `_inbox/CircusWiki - Technical Manual.md` is historical. It still contains older MkDocs-era details, but these durable principles remain valid:

- Content is the core value of the project.
- Markdown, YAML metadata, and assets are the persistent knowledge base.
- Presentation tools are secondary and replaceable.
- Keep content and presentation separated.
- Prefer open, plain-text, version-controlled formats.
- Preserve decentralization and long-term resilience through Git.
- Support multilingual access as a high-priority goal.
- Preserve meaningful internal linking and metadata-driven discovery.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in content structure; folders are mostly technical, while links and metadata carry knowledge structure.

When historical notes conflict with the current repo, prefer actual code/config first, then `README.md`, then this file.

## Content Editing Rules

- Preserve YAML frontmatter unless a task explicitly requires changing it.
- Do not bulk-reformat Markdown content without a clear reason.
- Preserve Obsidian-style constructs such as wikilinks, callouts, embeds, Dataview blocks, and canvas-related references.
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits to content files.
- Keep shared images and media in `docs/img/` unless an existing file clearly uses another convention.
- Be careful with non-English content. Do not translate, normalize, or rewrite prose unless explicitly asked.
- Do not delete drafts, inbox notes, templates, Dataview notes, or Obsidian configuration as cleanup. They are part of the working system.

## Translation Tooling

Read `_system/translation-architecture.md` before changing translation metadata, translation discovery, fallback behavior, or language-switching behavior.

Translation tooling currently lives in:

- `tools/translation/`
- `tools/translation_cli.py`
- `tools/dev_console/`
- `tools/dev_console.ps1`

The local translation console starts with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/dev_console.ps1
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

The current translation workflow:

- lists Markdown source files for an explicit source language
- maps target files to matching paths under an explicit target language
- inspects translation metadata and source hashes
- sends only the Markdown body to an OpenAI-compatible API
- writes translated output only to target files
- preserves unknown frontmatter fields

German is the current default public site language, not a permanent rule for canonical source language. Tooling should translate from each page's original source language as defined by metadata whenever possible.

Multilingual staging generates static fallback pages for known missing translations and writes `javascripts/translation-map.json`. Do not remove this fallback layer when changing build or language-switching behavior.

Translation metadata currently includes:

```yaml
lang: en
translation_id: ...
translation_source: docs/de/example.md
translation_source_lang: de
translation_source_hash: ...
translation_model: ...
translation_status: machine-translated
translation_updated: ...
```

API keys must never be committed. Use environment variables or a local `.env` file:

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "..."
$env:OPENROUTER_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001"
$env:OPENROUTER_BASE_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
```

The code also accepts `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Development Workflow

Use PowerShell-compatible commands by default on Windows.

Common setup:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Preview the default/German site only:

```powershell
python tools/stage_multilang.py
zensical serve
```

This serves only `zensical.toml` and does not run multilingual post-build steps. Do not use it to verify language switching, fallback pages, or hover previews.

Preview compiled multilingual site with the deployed `/circuswiki/` URL prefix:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/serve_multilang.ps1
```

Use the multilingual preview command when testing language switching, translated pages, fallback pages, hover previews, or final GitHub Pages URL shape. It builds all language configs first, augments generated sitemaps, and serves `site/`.

Build all language sites:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build_multilang.ps1
```

Run tooling checks:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/check.ps1
python tools/sync_configs.py
```

Translation CLI requires explicit languages:

```powershell
python tools/translation_cli.py health --source-lang de --target-lang en
python tools/translation_cli.py inspect "docs/de/index.md" --source-lang de --target-lang en
python tools/translation_cli.py translate "docs/de/index.md" --source-lang de --target-lang en --dry-run
```

GitHub Pages deployment:

- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds `site/` and deploys it through Actions-based GitHub Pages.
- The checked-in default URL shape remains `/circuswiki/` for the main/public repo.
- The dev repo workflow sets `CIRCUSWIKI_SITE_BASE_PATH=/circuswiki-dev/` and `CIRCUSWIKI_SITE_URL=https://nica-ev.github.io/circuswiki-dev/`.
- Do not hardcode `/circuswiki/` in runtime JS or staging logic. Use `CIRCUSWIKI_SITE_BASE_PATH` for build-time URLs and derive runtime asset roots from loaded script URLs.

## Agent Operating Rules

- Read `README.md` first for current setup.
- Check relevant source files before making implementation claims.
- Assume the working tree may contain user changes. Do not revert unrelated changes.
- Use `rg` for searching when available.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Keep generated files out of commits unless the user explicitly asks for generated output.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, local machine paths, virtual environments, caches, `.build/`, or `site/`.
- Do not migrate old tooling back in from historical docs unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- If changing translation behavior, verify both console and CLI entry points where applicable.
- If changing site structure, preserve language path parity where possible.
- If changing content-processing code, preserve Markdown frontmatter/body separation and Obsidian syntax.

## Documentation Priority

Use these sources in this order when deciding what is current:

1. Actual code and config in this repository.
2. `README.md`.
3. `AGENTS.md`.
4. `_system/` architecture notes for their specific domains.
5. `_inbox/` drafts only for project philosophy and historical context.
