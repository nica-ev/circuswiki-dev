      "taskId": 15,
      "taskTitle": "Implement YAML-only update for existing translated files",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of updating only the YAML frontmatter of existing translated files into subtasks, including reading files, parsing and validating YAML, updating fields, preserving body content, and handling file rewrite operations with error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves precise file manipulation: reading, parsing, and updating only the YAML frontmatter while ensuring the body remains unchanged. Challenges include handling various YAML schemas, preserving formatting, and ensuring atomic file writes. Best practices for YAML frontmatter and batch updates should be followed to avoid data loss or corruption[1][2][5]."

      "taskId": 16,
      "taskTitle": "Implement support for WikiLinks syntax",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps required to add WikiLinks syntax support to the MarkdownProcessor, including pattern recognition, AST traversal updates, selective translation of Alias, and thorough testing for edge cases.",
      "reasoning": "Adding WikiLinks support is moderately complex, requiring regex or parser updates to detect patterns, AST logic changes, and careful handling to translate only the Alias portion. The scope is limited to Markdown parsing and text extraction, but edge cases and integration with translation logic add some complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive error handling",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Identify and break down all major error sources in the application (configuration, file access, parsing, API, writing), and define subtasks for implementing detection, handling, reporting, and recovery strategies for each.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling is critical and complex, as it requires a systematic review of all components, consistent reporting, and robust recovery mechanisms. It must address diverse failure modes, ensure graceful degradation, and maintain application stability across the workflow."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 18,
      "taskTitle": "Implement detailed logging",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps to implement detailed logging, including log event identification, integration with Python's logging module, configuration options, log formatting, and ensuring logs are actionable for debugging and monitoring.",
      "reasoning": "While logging is a standard practice, implementing detailed, configurable, and actionable logs across all components requires careful planning. Ensuring logs are informative, non-redundant, and useful for both debugging and monitoring adds moderate complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 19,
      "taskTitle": "Implement extensible translation provider system",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps to refactor TranslationService for extensibility, including designing an abstract provider interface, implementing the initial DeepL provider, creating a provider factory, and ensuring future providers can be added easily.",
      "reasoning": "Designing for extensibility requires careful abstraction and interface design. Implementing the provider pattern, ensuring backward compatibility, and supporting future integration of new providers increases architectural complexity."

      "taskId": 20,
      "taskTitle": "Implement main application workflow",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the major workflow steps and orchestrations needed for the main application, including configuration loading, directory scanning, file processing, translation orchestration, progress reporting, summary statistics, and CLI interface design.",
      "reasoning": "This is the core orchestration task, integrating all components and managing the end-to-end workflow. It requires robust coordination, error handling, progress tracking, and a user-friendly CLI, making it the most complex and critical part of the system."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Robust HTML Parsing and Reassembly in MarkdownProcessor",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of robust HTML parsing and reassembly into subtasks, covering parser integration, tag/attribute configuration, text extraction, reassembly logic, error handling, and logging.",
      "reasoning": "Properly parsing and reconstructing HTML within Markdown is challenging due to the need for accurate extraction, preservation of structure, handling of malformed HTML, and configurability. Ensuring robustness and extensibility adds to the complexity."
