# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement basic MarkdownProcessor with AST generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a component to parse Markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for processing.
# Details:
Implement a MarkdownProcessor class that uses markdown-it-py to parse Markdown content into an AST. Include methods to separate frontmatter from body content. Create a basic traversal mechanism for the AST to access different node types.

# Test Strategy:
Parse various Markdown files and verify the AST structure matches expected output. Test with complex Markdown features like tables, lists, and code blocks to ensure correct parsing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create MarkdownProcessor class skeleton with markdown-it-py integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic structure of the MarkdownProcessor class with initialization and markdown-it-py integration
### Details:
Create a new file for the MarkdownProcessor class. Initialize the class with markdown-it-py as the parser. Include constructor parameters for configuration options. Set up basic methods for parsing markdown content. Add proper error handling for initialization failures. Include necessary imports and documentation.

## 2. Implement frontmatter extraction functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Add methods to detect, parse and separate YAML frontmatter from the main Markdown content
### Details:
Add a method to detect if frontmatter exists in the markdown content (typically delimited by '---'). Implement functionality to extract the frontmatter section. Use a YAML parser (like PyYAML) to convert the frontmatter into a Python dictionary. Return both the parsed frontmatter and the remaining markdown content. Handle edge cases like malformed frontmatter and provide appropriate error messages.

## 3. Develop AST generation from Markdown content [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create methods to parse Markdown content into an Abstract Syntax Tree representation
### Details:
Implement a method that takes markdown content and returns its AST representation using markdown-it-py. Ensure the method handles different markdown elements correctly (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.). Add validation to ensure the generated AST is properly structured. Include documentation about the structure of the returned AST. Implement error handling for parsing failures.

## 4. Implement basic AST traversal mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create utility methods to traverse and access different node types in the Markdown AST
### Details:
Develop a traversal method that can walk through the AST in depth-first order. Implement node type filtering to find specific elements (e.g., headings, links, code blocks). Create helper methods to extract text content from nodes. Add functionality to get the path to a specific node. Include methods to transform nodes or modify the AST structure. Document the traversal API with examples.

## 5. Add comprehensive processing method and test cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Create a main processing method that combines frontmatter extraction and AST generation with basic test cases
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive 'process' method that combines frontmatter extraction and AST generation. Return a structured result containing frontmatter data and the document AST. Add utility methods for common AST operations based on the traversal mechanism. Create test cases with various markdown inputs to verify correct processing. Include examples of extracting specific information from the AST. Document the complete API with usage examples.
