# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement comprehensive error handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add robust error handling throughout the application.
# Details:
Review all components and add comprehensive error handling. Include specific handling for: configuration errors, file access issues, parsing errors, API errors (with retries), and file writing failures. Implement a consistent error reporting mechanism. Add recovery options where possible to continue processing other files when one fails.

# Test Strategy:
Create test scenarios that trigger various error conditions. Verify errors are caught, reported clearly, and handled appropriately. Confirm the application can continue processing other files when possible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design error handling architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a consistent error handling architecture and reporting mechanism
### Details:
Define error types/categories (configuration, file access, parsing, API, file writing). Create a centralized error handling utility with standardized error objects. Design error logging format with severity levels, timestamps, context data, and stack traces. Define how errors propagate through the application. Document the architecture for team reference.

## 2. Implement configuration and startup error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Add error handling for application configuration and startup processes
### Details:
Implement validation for configuration files/parameters with descriptive error messages. Add try-catch blocks around startup processes. Create fallback mechanisms for missing/invalid configurations. Implement graceful shutdown procedures for critical startup failures. Add detailed logging for configuration-related errors.

## 3. Implement file access and parsing error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Add error handling for file operations and data parsing
### Details:
Add try-catch blocks around file read/write operations. Implement specific error types for file not found, permission issues, and corruption. Create recovery mechanisms to skip problematic files and continue processing others. Add validation for parsed data with appropriate error messages. Implement retry logic for temporary file access issues.

## 4. Implement API error handling with retry mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Add robust error handling for all API interactions
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff retry logic for API calls. Handle different HTTP status codes appropriately. Add timeout handling for API requests. Create circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures. Implement fallback mechanisms when APIs are unavailable. Add detailed logging of API errors with request/response information.

## 5. Implement UI error feedback mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options in the UI
### Details:
Design user-friendly error messages that avoid technical jargon. Implement toast notifications for non-critical errors. Create modal dialogs for critical errors requiring user action. Add retry buttons for failed operations where appropriate. Implement error boundaries in UI components to prevent complete UI crashes. Create an error details expansion option for technical users.

## 6. Implement global error monitoring and reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5
### Description: Create a system to monitor, aggregate and report application errors
### Details:
Implement a global error handler to catch unhandled exceptions. Create an error dashboard showing error frequency and patterns. Add automated alerts for critical or frequent errors. Implement error aggregation to group similar errors. Create error reports with filtering options. Add telemetry to track error resolution times and effectiveness of error handling.
