# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Robust HTML Parsing and Reassembly in MarkdownProcessor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the MarkdownProcessor to properly parse HTML content within Markdown documents, extract text from allowed HTML tags, and correctly reassemble translated content while preserving structure.
# Details:
Implement a robust HTML parsing and reassembly system in the MarkdownProcessor class with the following components:

1. HTML Parser Integration:
   - Integrate a reliable HTML parsing library (BeautifulSoup or html.parser) to identify and extract HTML blocks within Markdown content
   - Create a configurable HTML tag whitelist system that specifies which tags and attributes should be processed
   - Implement proper handling of nested HTML structures

2. Text Extraction Strategy:
   - Develop a configurable strategy to extract text content from specific allowed HTML tags (e.g., <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <li>, <td>, <th>)
   - Extract text from relevant attributes of specific tags (e.g., alt from <img>, title from <a>)
   - Preserve the original HTML structure, including all attributes and non-text content
   - Handle special cases like HTML entities and CDATA sections correctly

3. HTML Reassembly:
   - Create a system to correctly reintegrate translated text back into the original HTML structure
   - Ensure all original attributes, tag hierarchies, and non-translatable elements remain intact
   - Implement proper escaping to prevent HTML injection or malformation
   - Maintain original whitespace and formatting where appropriate

4. Configuration System:
   - Create a configuration interface that allows users to specify:
     * Which HTML tags should have their text content extracted for translation
     * Which attributes of which tags should be extracted for translation
     * Any tags that should be completely ignored/preserved as-is

5. Error Handling:
   - Implement robust error handling for malformed HTML
   - Add detailed logging for parsing and reassembly operations
   - Ensure the system degrades gracefully when encountering unexpected HTML structures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test HTML parsing with various HTML structures (simple tags, nested tags, self-closing tags)
   - Test extraction of text from different allowed tags and attributes
   - Test reassembly with different complexity levels of HTML
   - Test handling of malformed HTML input
   - Test with HTML entities and special characters

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the complete workflow from Markdown with embedded HTML through parsing, extraction, translation, and reassembly
   - Verify that the original structure is preserved after processing
   - Test with real-world examples of Markdown documents containing HTML

3. Edge Cases:
   - Test with extremely large HTML blocks
   - Test with uncommon but valid HTML structures
   - Test with HTML containing mixed language content
   - Test with HTML containing code samples or other non-translatable content

4. Validation Methods:
   - Compare the DOM structure before and after processing to ensure they match
   - Verify all attributes are preserved exactly as in the original
   - Confirm that only the text content from allowed tags/attributes is modified
   - Use HTML validators to ensure the output remains valid HTML

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and establish performance benchmarks for processing documents with varying amounts of HTML content
   - Ensure memory usage remains reasonable with large documents
