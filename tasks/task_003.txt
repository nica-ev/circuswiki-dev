# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement basic FileManager for directory scanning
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a component to recursively scan directories and identify Markdown files.
# Details:
Implement a FileManager class with methods to scan the INPUT_DIR recursively and identify all .md files. Use pathlib for cross-platform path handling. Include error handling for directory access issues. Return a list of file paths for further processing.

# Test Strategy:
Create test directories with various file types. Verify the scanner correctly identifies all .md files and handles nested directories properly. Test error cases like non-existent or inaccessible directories.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create FileManager class structure with configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic FileManager class with initialization parameters and configuration for directory scanning
### Details:
Create a FileManager class with an __init__ method that accepts INPUT_DIR parameter. Initialize class variables for storing configuration like file extensions to scan for (.md). Use pathlib.Path for handling the input directory path to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Include basic validation to check if the provided path exists and is a directory.

<info added on 2025-05-04T01:12:59.138Z>
The FileManager class has been implemented in the specified location with the following enhancements:

- Added proper error handling with specific exceptions (`FileNotFoundError` when path doesn't exist, `NotADirectoryError` when path is not a directory)
- Implemented logging using Python's built-in logging module for tracking operations
- Created a `target_extension` attribute set to '.md' for filtering markdown files
- Used pathlib.Path's resolve() method to convert relative paths to absolute paths
- Added docstrings following PEP 257 conventions for better code documentation
- Implemented type hints for better IDE support and code readability
- Added a __repr__ method for better debugging representation of the class instance

The class is now ready for extension with file scanning and processing methods.

## 2. Implement recursive directory scanning logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a method to recursively traverse directories and collect file paths
### Details:
Implement a _scan_directory method that takes a directory path and recursively traverses it. Use pathlib's iterdir() and is_dir() methods for directory traversal. Create a helper method to check if a file matches the target extension (.md). Build the scanning logic to collect all matching file paths into a list. Ensure the method handles the recursive nature of directory traversal properly.

<info added on 2025-05-04T01:13:17.523Z>
The method implementation uses a depth-first search approach for directory traversal. For case-insensitive extension matching, it converts both the file suffix and target extension to lowercase before comparison (e.g., `if file_path.suffix.lower() == self.target_extension.lower()`). Debug logging statements are added at key points to track traversal progress and file discovery using the Python logging module. The method handles potential permission errors with try/except blocks to prevent crashes when accessing restricted directories. For performance optimization, it uses a generator-based approach internally before collecting results into the final list. The implementation also respects symbolic links but doesn't follow them to avoid potential infinite loops in the filesystem traversal.

## 3. Add error handling for directory access issues [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Enhance the scanning logic with robust error handling for permission and access issues
### Details:
Modify the directory scanning method to include try-except blocks for handling common errors: PermissionError for access denied scenarios, FileNotFoundError for missing directories, and a general exception handler for unexpected issues. Log appropriate error messages for each case. Implement a strategy to continue scanning when encountering inaccessible subdirectories rather than failing the entire process. Consider adding a method to report scanning errors encountered.

<info added on 2025-05-04T01:13:47.581Z>
For the error handling implementation, consider these specific details:

Create a structured `ScanError` class to track error information:
```python
class ScanError:
    def __init__(self, path, error_type, message):
        self.path = path
        self.error_type = error_type
        self.message = message
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
```

In the `_scan_directory_recursive` method, implement granular error handling:
```python
def _scan_directory_recursive(self, directory, relative_path=""):
    found_files = []
    errors = []
    
    try:
        for item in directory.iterdir():
            try:
                item_rel_path = os.path.join(relative_path, item.name)
                
                if item.is_dir() and not item.name.startswith('.'):
                    subdir_files, subdir_errors = self._scan_directory_recursive(item, item_rel_path)
                    found_files.extend(subdir_files)
                    errors.extend(subdir_errors)
                elif item.is_file() and self._matches_pattern(item.name):
                    found_files.append((item, item_rel_path))
            except PermissionError as e:
                error = ScanError(str(item), "PermissionError", f"Access denied: {str(e)}")
                errors.append(error)
                self.logger.warning(f"Permission error accessing {item}: {e}")
            except Exception as e:
                error = ScanError(str(item), type(e).__name__, str(e))
                errors.append(error)
                self.logger.error(f"Error processing {item}: {e}")
    except PermissionError as e:
        error = ScanError(str(directory), "PermissionError", f"Cannot list directory: {str(e)}")
        errors.append(error)
        self.logger.warning(f"Permission error listing directory {directory}: {e}")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        error = ScanError(str(directory), "FileNotFoundError", str(e))
        errors.append(error)
        self.logger.warning(f"Directory not found: {directory}")
    
    return found_files, errors
```

Add a public method to retrieve scan errors:
```python
def get_scan_errors(self):
    """Returns a list of errors encountered during the last scan operation."""
    return self.errors
```

Implement a method to summarize errors by type:
```python
def get_error_summary(self):
    """Returns a summary of errors grouped by error type."""
    summary = {}
    for error in self.errors:
        if error.error_type not in summary:
            summary[error.error_type] = 0
        summary[error.error_type] += 1
    return summary
```

## 4. Create public scan method with result formatting [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Implement the main public method that initiates scanning and returns properly formatted results
### Details:
Create a public scan_markdown_files method that calls the internal scanning logic and returns a list of pathlib.Path objects representing all found Markdown files. Include options for returning absolute or relative paths. Add documentation explaining the return format and possible exceptions. Implement basic statistics collection (number of files found, directories scanned, errors encountered) that can be optionally returned or logged. Test the method with various directory structures to ensure it works correctly.

<info added on 2025-05-04T01:14:12.388Z>
For the `scan_markdown_files` method, consider implementing these specific details:

```python
def scan_markdown_files(self, relative_paths=False, collect_stats=True):
    """
    Scan for Markdown files in the configured directories.
    
    Args:
        relative_paths (bool): If True, returns paths relative to base directory
        collect_stats (bool): If True, collects and logs scanning statistics
        
    Returns:
        List[pathlib.Path]: List of found Markdown files
        
    Raises:
        DirectoryAccessError: If base directory cannot be accessed
        ScanConfigurationError: If no valid directories are configured
    """
    self.errors = []
    start_time = time.time()
    stats = {"files_found": 0, "dirs_scanned": 0, "errors": 0} if collect_stats else None
    
    found_files = []
    for directory in self.directories:
        try:
            files, dir_stats = self._scan_directory_recursive(directory, stats=stats)
            found_files.extend(files)
            if stats:
                stats["dirs_scanned"] += dir_stats["dirs_scanned"]
                stats["files_found"] += dir_stats["files_found"]
                stats["errors"] += len(dir_stats["errors"])
            self.errors.extend(dir_stats.get("errors", []))
        except Exception as e:
            self.errors.append(ScanError(str(directory), str(e)))
            if stats:
                stats["errors"] += 1
    
    # Process paths based on relative_paths flag
    if relative_paths:
        found_files = [p.relative_to(self.base_directory) for p in found_files]
    
    if collect_stats:
        elapsed = time.time() - start_time
        self.logger.info(f"Scan completed: {stats['files_found']} files found in {stats['dirs_scanned']} directories ({elapsed:.2f}s)")
        if stats["errors"] > 0:
            self.logger.warning(f"{stats['errors']} errors encountered during scan")
    
    return found_files
```

Also add a helper method to retrieve scan errors:

```python
def get_scan_errors(self):
    """
    Returns the list of errors encountered during the last scan.
    
    Returns:
        List[ScanError]: List of error objects with path and error message
    """
    return self.errors
```

Consider creating a `ScanResult` dataclass to provide a more structured return value that includes both files and statistics.
