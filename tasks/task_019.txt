# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement extensible translation provider system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Refactor TranslationService to support multiple translation providers.
# Details:
Refactor TranslationService to use a provider pattern. Create an abstract base class or interface for translation providers. Implement the DeepL provider as the initial concrete implementation. Add factory method to create the appropriate provider based on API_PROVIDER configuration. Design for easy addition of new providers in the future.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the DeepL provider works correctly through the new abstraction. Create a simple mock provider for testing. Confirm the factory correctly instantiates providers based on configuration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ITranslationProvider interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the interface that all translation providers must implement
### Details:
Create an interface named ITranslationProvider that defines the contract for all translation providers. Include methods for translation (e.g., translateText, translateBatch), language detection, and any other common functionality. Add documentation to each method explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values. Consider adding methods for provider initialization and validation of API credentials.

## 2. Implement DeepL provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create the first concrete implementation of ITranslationProvider for DeepL
### Details:
Create a DeepLTranslationProvider class that implements the ITranslationProvider interface. Move the existing DeepL-specific code from TranslationService into this new class. Ensure all interface methods are properly implemented. Handle API key configuration, request formatting, error handling, and response parsing specific to DeepL. Add unit tests to verify the implementation works correctly.

## 3. Create TranslationProviderFactory [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Implement a factory class to instantiate the appropriate provider
### Details:
Create a TranslationProviderFactory class with a createProvider method that returns an instance of ITranslationProvider based on configuration. Read the API_PROVIDER configuration value to determine which provider to instantiate. Initially support only the DeepL provider, but design the factory to be easily extended with additional providers. Include error handling for unknown or misconfigured providers. Consider implementing a singleton pattern if appropriate for your architecture.

## 4. Refactor TranslationService [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Update TranslationService to use the provider pattern
### Details:
Refactor the existing TranslationService to use the provider pattern. Remove DeepL-specific code that was moved to DeepLTranslationProvider. Update the service to get a provider instance from TranslationProviderFactory and delegate translation operations to it. Maintain the same public API to ensure backward compatibility with existing code. Update any configuration handling to work with the new provider system. Add appropriate error handling for provider failures.

## 5. Add configuration and documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Update configuration files and add documentation for the new provider system
### Details:
Update configuration files to support the new provider system. Add documentation explaining how to configure different translation providers. Create a guide for implementing new providers, including a template or example. Update existing documentation to reflect the changes. Add comments in the code explaining the provider pattern implementation. Consider creating a simple mock provider for testing purposes. Verify that the existing functionality works with the new implementation through integration tests.
